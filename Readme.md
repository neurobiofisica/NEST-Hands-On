Nest Examples
===========

The Nest Initiative is one of the most widely used tools for modelling
in computational neuroscience. Here you will find several notebooks
that can be used as resources to understand and learn how to use Nest
and several other python libraries together, creating a powerful
environment for both study and research in neuroscience.

Idea and current status
-----

Being relatively new, documentation and examples for NEST are still
scarce and working with it may prove hard, especially for your first
programs. This is the original reason I have made available these
notebooks. Most of them are sanity checks, but may be very well be
used to learn tricks.
