Nest Examples
===========

The Nest Initiative is one of the most widely used tools for modeling
in computational neuroscience. Here you will find several notebooks
that can be used as resources to understand and learn how to combine Nest
with iPython notebooks, NumPy and Pandas, creating a powerful
environment for both study and research in neuroscience.

Accessing notebooks

If you just want to visualize our notebooks (no need to install
anything!), just click on the links below. If you want to run/modify
them, clone this repository or download it
[zipped](https://github.com/neurobiofisica/NEST-Hands-On/archive/master.zip).

* [Response of single cell to current injection](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/neurobiofisica/NEST-Hands-On/blob/master/notebooks/response_of_single_cell_to_current.ipynb)

* [Two coupled cells under Poisson noise](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/neurobiofisica/NEST-Hands-On/blob/master/notebooks/two_cells_under_poisson_noise.ipynb)

Wikis
-----

I have also included a wiki on [how to install NEST in Fedora
systems](https://github.com/neurobiofisica/NEST-Hands-On/blob/master/Howto%20Install/Howto_Install.wiki).


Idea and current status
-----

Being relatively new, documentation and examples for NEST are still
scarce and working with it may prove hard, especially for your first
programs. This is the original reason I have made available these
notebooks. Most of them are sanity checks, but may be very well be
used to learn tricks.
